If you want to create your own keyboard layout copy one of the existing layout and edit it.  

Most of the time ``display`` and ``value`` will be the same, but for the AZERTY (ie) I translated it into french so it differs. 
Just keep the english value for ``value`` and do whatever you want with ``display``.
   
Don't forget to change the description and add an picture of the layout.  
The available classes for the rows will be added later in this document, for now you can find them in ``app/css/index.css``.
