CS:GO Binds Generator - Angular Branch
=========

This branch is dedicated to the rework of the app with Angular. It may take time to be usable.  
Anyway if you want to see what's up, clone the repo, checkout the ``angular`` branch and then run  
  
``npm start``  
  
Remember that it may take some times to download the necessary libs.  

If you've got any problem open an issue but keep in mind that it is a dev branch.
